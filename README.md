products all over India and selling them online. It boasts of 5,000 products and a reach across
India’s top 20 cities through i ts dedicated e-commerce portal. It runs on a pre-order model,
where i t collects demand for a particular product for 2 weeks before placing the purchase order
to the supplier and then dispatching i t to the end consumer. The client has come to you to

sales for the first 2 months, but i t charges 10% of purchase price to recover l ogistics and
listing costs. If the product i s from an existing supplier but of a new product category,
then this benefit i s extended for 1 month for the new product.
● If the product i s a best seller, i .e., the total quantity ordered exceeds 500 units for a
month, i t offers no discounts on the product. If the product i s not a best seller, but the
total quantity ordered i s more than the minimum order quantity of 200 units, i t offers a
15% discount on l ist price. If monthly demand i s even below the minimum order quantity,
35% discount on l ist price i s offered. If total demand after offering 35% discount does not
go beyond 200 units, the product i s dropped from the ecommerce portal.
